              I believe the City Officials are failing to see the noise pollution issue from the perspective of the sufferers.
              hence they are refusing to believe there is a problem. and therefore the inaction to help solve it.

              Dear Chandler Residents,<br>
              We recently completed a power project at our Chandler data center campus and were contacted by the city that there were concerns around the noise emanating from the generators. We would like to update you on what was done and let you know that we will inform with this newsletter all future projects on the campus. 
              In regards to the project completed in April, additional power feeds were installed to the campus as well as switch gear maintenance that requires us to transfer load from the electrical grid to generators in order to make the needed upgrades. This was a two part project and was conducted between the hours of 6 am – 6 pm: <br>
              April 6 – Functionality Test – all power transferred to the generators. This was the loudest day as all generators were tested. <br>
              April 7 – Upgrades/maintenance w/ minimal generator use needed <br>
              April 8 – Upgrades/maintenance with roughly half the generators engaged <br>
              April 9 – Minimal generators needed, first half of project completed <br>
              No work was scheduled for the week of April 12-16. The second phase of the project was scheduled during the week of April 19-23 but did not require us to transfer the full load to the generators. The project was completed Wednesday, April 21, two days earlier than planned. <br>
              Any future projects that have potential to impact the surrounding community will be communicated through this newsletter so that both the city and the surrounding neighborhood ample notification. Please forward this newsletter to anyone who might find it of value. Requests to be added to the newsletter distribution as well as other questions or comments can be sent to MarketingPR@cyrusone.com. <br>
              Thank you,
              CyrusOne Community Relations
